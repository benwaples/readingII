## regexr - cheat sheet
The format on all regex is the same, however how each character is used is different. For example `\s` is for finding all white space in a given group (`([A-Z])`), where as `\S` is for finding all the non-white space in a given group. For some reason there is an `a-g` class for finding characters between a-g... not sure about that. Using regex you can match a specific character and then also can match a given number of characters after that, before that, or all matching characters. Made a good amount of sense, until I started trying to use the built in tool.

## regex tutorial
The symbol quantifiers are strange, why are there so many that deal with 0 and 1?. My questions is, when/ how do I use it? Both readings have been about the specific characters and how each work. And this gives examples, but not in full context and I don't see when to use it.

## regex 101
This is nice. Can actually see what these commands are doing. I would still like to see how to use it in full. Yes I am finding the characters/words, however what next?
