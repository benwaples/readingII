## Consider the History
70% of roles at top tech companys are held by male employees... Since the 80's, more men than women are graduating in Computer Science.

Early video games played on the computer were directed towards men, giving them an 'leg up' when it came to computing.

I'll never think of Gameboy the same again.

College Computer Science is so boys cluby that it creates a big barrier of entry for women. And when women get jobs in tech after college, a third want to quit within their first year. 38% of women get their ideas endorsed by management, compared to 44% by men.

## Review the Data
This data set is awesome, but very sad. Not much diversity in tech. Scrolling to the bottom of the page, you really can see how lack of diversity of thought isn't just a in tech, but these tech companies aren't even doing average of the other comparisons. We can make it better!

## Ask The Question
### List of reasons why diversity of thought on a team is better.
* diverse teams are smarter and more creative when it comes to problem solving</br>
* Diverse companies perform better, for example, a 2011 study found that female representation in top management led to a $42 million firm value increase</br>
* Companies must not only hire, but attract people from underrepresented backgrounds in order to not miss out on talent. </br>
* Diverse companies perform better for more user</br>
* Because listening to everyone and hearing what they have to say is the right thing to do.</br>
