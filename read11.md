## Styling HTML Forms

### 1 - directory and set up
* set up your directory with the correct files and format your HTML with the correct elements </br>
* Do basic styling to make sure your form is linked to CSS and use simple tricks to set up the form to look nice.</br>

### 2 - radio buttons
* use your own img for a radio button</br>
* hide the existing radio circles</br>
* put your new check boxes on in a separate `img` folder</br>
* do some css pseudo classes and selectors to change the radio button image and font color when a radio button is selected</br>


### 3 - Checkboxes
* pretty much the same thing as step 2, but instead of replacing the radio buttons and accessing the labels, replace checkboxes</br>
* how does this person know what `background-positions` to set these photos too? Is that just experience, or am I missing some meta data?</br>
* I like how they traverse the dom with these CSS selectors</br>

### 4 - Text Inputs
* using `feildset` in HTML adds some cool style to the form</br>
* give elements their own space, and especially when there is an img</br>
* `border-radius` is nice</br>
* did pretty much the same stuff as before</br>

### 5 - Select Boxes
* browsers apply their own default styles to HTML elements</br>
* vendor prefix?? wtf that was sick</br>
* I like how they tie all the different elements together and make the whole form very consistent with widths and padding </br>
* They are really fast with the shortcut CSS tricks like `background-image` and using all of it's property's</br>
* `box-shadow` is really cool when it is used subtly</br>


### 6 - Validation Styles
* that psuedo class `:valid` is pretty cool, but does it work according to the email and phone number?</br>
* it does!! SICK!!</br>
* using a `<span>` with a class tick is a good way to add a little check mark when a input is validated</br>
* I like the really subtle changes that the form does when something is validated</br>
