## Applying Atomic Design
### Part 1
Atoms are so small that if you tried to find anything smaller, you would have to split an atom and it would be an atom anything any more. When designing a page, split it up into large sections (organisms), then smaller sections (molecules), then get the elements that can't be broken up any further (atoms).

### Part 2
First create your atoms. Not all atoms are the same, so just make your atoms and tell it what to do later. For example a `<p>` tag is for text -- tell it what size of text later on. Then your molecules (reusing atoms) and then combine your molecules to have organisms.
