SQL is a way for users to query, manipulate and transform data in a relational database. It is simple, safe, and scalable for large applications.

Relational data base is a collection of related tables (aka two dimensional). Similar to an excel sheet, these databases have a fixed number of columns (named) and an unlimited number of rows (entry's).

`SELECT` statements are query's - declaring the data we want.</br>

`WHERE` to get specific rows. use the column followed by a operator and a value. </br>

Text values are a thing. There are databases completely dedicated to full-text searches. So this happens to be a thing. </br>

`DISTINCT` is a way to remove duplicate column values.</br>

`ORDER BY` will output your results in ascending or descending order.</br>

`Limit` will limit the number of results that return</br>

database schema is what describes the structure of each table and the datatype of each column.</br>

`INSERT` to add new data entry's into a table</br>
