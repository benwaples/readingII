SQL is a way for users to query, manipulate and transform data in a relational database. It is simple, safe, and scalable for large applications.

Relational data base is a collection of related tables (aka two dimensional). Similar to an excel sheet, these databases have a fixed number of columns (named) and an unlimited number of rows (entry's).

`SELECT` statements are query's - declaring the data we want.</br>

`WHERE` to get specific rows. use the column followed by a operator and a value. </br>

Text values are a thing. There are databases completely dedicated to full-text searches. So this happens to be a thing. </br>

`DISTINCT` is a way to remove duplicate column values.</br>

`ORDER BY` will output your results in ascending or descending order.</br>

`Limit` will limit the number of results that return</br>

database schema is what describes the structure of each table and the datatype of each column.</br>

`INSERT INTO` to add new data entry's into a table</br>

`UPDATE` is used to update a existing data</br>

`DELETE FROM` to delete from a table</br>

`CREATE TABLE` ... </br>

`ALTER TABLE` and `ADD` to add new columns</br>

`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` to delete a table entirely - data included.</br>

This is sweet! Really helpful to just test what I learned from the last reading. Maybe a good resource to save for the future to see if my calls are working well before I make a big mistake in a database call!
