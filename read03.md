## RWD 
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website (or web app) that is suitable on every device with any screen size. flex grids are useful to make a responsive layout on a webpage. The dimensions are defined as percentages or `em`. `target รท context = result` following that rule will help determine how large each element shout be. `target` being the element you are trying to size, `context` being the parent element size, and `result` ya. `@media` helps define element sizes and layouts on different devices, which 'opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.'

## Floats
Float elements allow text to go around them, but remain part of the flow of the webpage. But you can use it on any elements, not just `<img>` over `<p>`. `Float` will make an element behave like a block element, instead of wrapping around the float, it would be stacked.

## Don't Over Think Grids
Im seeing a note here that flexbox and grid are more powerful than what ill find in this article. So I learned what `box-size: border-box` does! Sets the size of the box to be the size declared, where as the default box-size sets it as the size of the content box.
