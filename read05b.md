# Reading Summary for Read 05b

## Problem Solving
Be open minded -- throw out your "solution" and try again.</br>
Be inquisitive -- ask questions, look for patterns or things that stand out.</br>
Ask the right questions -- like what is it doing now, what do you want it to do?</br>
Slow down -- try to explain the problem verbally and see what new insights you get. </br>
Don't be Lazy -- look at the details.</br>
Don't Panic -- stay calm when things are hard or are not going your way. You'll think clearer and better.</br>
Make sure you solve the right problem by continually asking 'why is this happening'</br>
Problem Solving Process -- Assess the problem, make a hypothesis, test the hypothesis </br>
Focus on function over purpose -- just because an item is intended to do one thing, doesn't mean it can do all sorts of other things. Like a tooth brush </br>
Break down the problem into smaller problems

## Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is a learned skill: 
1. Question assumptions: lots of ways to do this, but try thinking of alternatives to current solutions as a way to start. </br>
2. Reason through logic: test your assumptions </br>
3. Diversify thought: Two people most likely see the world differently, 10 people definitely do, make friends with people who do different things than you and listen to them </br>

## Power of Questions
ask questions. Ask questions people want to answer. Ask follow up questions. Ask open ended questions in low risk situations. Less-sensitive questions -> more sensitive question when building a relationship, opposite when negotiating. Ask questions casually. Be transparent when answering questions too.
