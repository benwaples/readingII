## JS templates
### Template literals 
These things are really handy! We have been using them a lot during foundations I. `how was your day, ${}`

### Getting Literal
I like how with template literals you can do some JS inside of the {}. It is very help ful when creating custom messages! `This year on my birthday I will be ${lastYear + 1}`

### Template Literals
Using template literals in a function never occurred to me. You could create whole html elements like this and and be able to add the right ids/classes and other attributes much quicker!

## Array Methods
### Array.forEach()
`.forEach()` will execute a function for each position on an array. It takes in a call back function for each position on the array, and then returns that to the forEach() function.s

### for loops vs. forEach
For loops are hand when you want to count other things that aren't arrays. Otherwise they are pretty much the same and .forEach is easier to read.
